# TimeZonePicker
A super-simple time zone picker made with Blazor

This tiny app was made as an accessory to an internal management system I made for a client.
They send the above link to their customers to make sure he can choose the correct time zone easily.
The customter then provides them with the IANA ID for his time zone which is then saved to the management system's database for various time zone calculations related to his data.
